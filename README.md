# PROJECT

in this project I made about planets, using Svelte js, and SASS. This project was derived from FrontEndMentor.io website They gave me a design system and screenshots to use for this.


# DIFFICULTIES

The biggest issue I had in this was in my opinion navigating through the JSON in a logical fashion and while not over doing it in.
another issue I had was, orginally I wanted to take items from the Json and put them into an array to display, but thought that was quite ineffectient. Then opted to use the find method and take the items I found and displayed this. I thought this worked out better. it was a little troublesome to get to work. But I felt accomplished to get it done.
